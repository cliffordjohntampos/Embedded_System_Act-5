Instability is undesirable in vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems. There is no opportunity for error in processes like automatic lane switching and automatic braking. A memory protection unit can aid in preventing cascade failures when it comes to storage, although memory problems can still bring about system failures on their own. The absence of memory issues in your code may be ensured by internal testing. Additionally, self-testing in the field will confirm that your ADAS enabled car is functional before it begins to drive. Your work isn't finished until your product leaves your workplace. You may identify issues early on and lower your chance of failure by using self-testing systems to evaluate if your memory is functioning in the field. You don't want technological forensics at a crash site to reveal that your memory wasn't functioning. Self-testing enables you to identify issues before they become harmful on the road, in the parking lot where they are a nuisance.
